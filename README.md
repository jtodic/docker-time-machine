# 🐳 Docker Time Machine (DTM)

Track your Docker image evolution through git history locally!
Commits are analyzed following git's parent chain (depth-first), not in chronological order by date.

## Features
- 📊 Track image size changes across commits
- ⚡ Monitor build performance trends
- 🔍 Find exactly which commit introduced bloat
- 📈 Generate interactive HTML reports
- 🎯 Binary search for regressions
- 🔄 Compare branches locally

⚠️ **Note on Build Times:** Build times are indicative only and depend on Docker's layer cache state.
